```
git clone https://github.com/z13g/CinemaBooking/
```

<p>2.2 Open the solution</p>

```
Open the .sln file in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
```

<h4>2.3 Configure Database:</h4>

<p>2.3.1 Connection String</p>

```
Replace the connection string in appsettings.json with your desired database connection details (avoid using master database).
```

<p>2.3.2 Migrations Folder</p>

```
Delete Migrations Folder (Optional): If the Migrations folder already exists you can delete it to start fresh with the database schema.
```

<h4>2.4 Make Migrations:</h4>

<p>2.4.1 Open NuGet PMC</p>

```
Open the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console).
```

<p>2.4.2 Add New Migration</p>

```
Run the command add-migration [Migration name] (replace [Migration name] with a descriptive name for your initial migration). This creates migration files defining the database schema changes.
```

<p>2.5 Update Database</p>

```
After the migration files are generated run the command update-database to apply the migrations and create the database tables. This might take some time depending on the complexity of your database schema.
